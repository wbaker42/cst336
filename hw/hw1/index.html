			<h2>Sorting algorithms are an essential part of computer science. But what is a sorting algorithm?</h2>
			
			<p>An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed to solve a certain problem. In this case the problem is how to sort data. One reason data must be sorted is
			because it allows it to be used with the highly efficient binary searcg algorithm. </p>
			<p>This problem is trivial when it comes to small amounts of data such as a grocery list. However when the amounts of data grows, such as an employee directory for a large
			company, the effiency of the sorting algorithm becomes very important.</p>
			<p>The efficiency of algorithms is written as O(). This tells how many operations for the amount of data to be processed. For example if it is O(n) that means as more
			data is added, the time to process this data grows in a linear fashion. Where as if it is O(n^2) it grows in a parabolic fashion.</p>
