				<p><a href= "https://brilliant.org/wiki/insertion/" id ="source">Insertion sort</a> is one of the most intuitive, and therefore easist to implement, sorting algorithms. It basically consists of iterating through an array
				and then finding where each element belongs with the already inspected arrays. This algorithm has the potential to be extremely efficient at O(n) however
				this only occurs if the array is already close to being sorted. As a worst case, which is also its average case, it is O(n^2) which makes it slow in comparison
				to other algorithms. It is also a stable sort.</p>
