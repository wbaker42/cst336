				<p><a href= "https://brilliant.org/wiki/quick-sort/" id ="source">Quick sort</a> is one of the most important sorting algorithms. This algorithm employs a divide and conquer strategy. It randomly selects a pivot point. It then
				compares pairs of elements on either side of the pivot and then swaps them if the one on the left is greater than the pivot and the one on the right is less than
				the pivot. This ensures that every the pivot is in the correct position. This algorithm has the potential to be extremely inefficient at O(n^2) however this only 
				occurs if the selected pivot is the max or min in the array. As the best and average case, it is O(nlogn). This is of course less efficient than the O(n) possible
				with both bubble and insertion sort. However since the average case is more efficient, it is generally a much more efficient algorithm. It is often implemented
				as an unstable sort.</p>
